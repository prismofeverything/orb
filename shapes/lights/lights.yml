# The `shape` section is the arrangement of the lights in your system - change
# this to match your actual lights.  The example is for a matrix that is 32
# pixels wide and 48 high.
#
# Using `shape` only works if you have a strip, a matrix, or a cube.
# For more complex shapes, you will use the `layout` section

shape: 144


# The `driver` section describes the hardware outputs you are using.
#
# In this sample file, the driver is the SimPixel LED simulator which runs
# in the browser; in a real project, that would be replaced by the right
# hardware driver and its settings.

# This is the animation section, which describes how your lights change over
# time.

# Here are alternative animation sections that are commented out that you
# could edit and use.


# # Here's the animation section for a looping sequence of animations, each 10
# # seconds long.
